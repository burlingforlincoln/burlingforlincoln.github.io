better education for economics ....

average citizen understood economics, nonsense in washington would be impossible politically. 



What's tragic is that there's so many people out there who simply respond to words rather than ask themselves 'Is what this person says true? How can I check it?' And so on

"I've seen no hard evidence. And, unfortunately, we’re living in a time where no one expects hard evidence. You just repeat some familiar words and people will react pretty much the way Pavlov’s dog was conditioned to react to certain sounds

             		I will keep the 1619 project out of Lincoln schools and advance a genuine civics education as recommended in the 1776 Commission because our children should grow up with pride for their country. There's no place for anti-American rhetoric in our elementary and middle schools. While, yes, there were terrible atrocities committed throughout American history, our children aren't mature enough to understand the moral and ethical dilemmas that our ancestors faced. Save those discussions for AP US History classes and university lectures.
